					<h1>School</h1>
					<p>
						When I was in high school I really wanted to do something computer based. I really enjoyed tinkering around with different computers in the computer labs. 
						I took a couple of classes that were just intro classes to things like html, C++, and Java. I really enjoyed it so I continued to pursue it. Going into computers
						influenced my choice of what college I wanted to attend. I looked around for high job placement and small colleges. Lone and behold Michigan Tech fits that resume perfectly.
